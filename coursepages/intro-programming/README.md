# Introduction to Programming

If you've never written a for-loop, or don't know what a string is in programming, start here. These courses are self-paced, allowing you to adjust the number of hours you spend per week to meet your needs.

We are currently looking for volunteers to try out both of the following two courses and analyze them in different ways to determine which one is better suited to be included in our  curriculum. We suggest that you flip a coin to decide which one to take first, so that you avoid an ordering bias. Once you have completed both courses, please provide your analysis of [this RFC](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science/issues/1164).

If you don't have time or do not want to volunteer, you are required to do **only ONE** of the following courses.

## CS50P: Introduction to Programming with Python

This course has been developed by the CS50 team at Harvard University.
> An introduction to programming using a language called Python. Learn how to read and write code as well as how to test and "debug" it. Designed for students with or without prior programming experience who'd like to learn Python specifically. Learn about functions, arguments, and return values (oh my!); variables and types; conditionals and Boolean expressions; and loops. Learn how to handle exceptions, find and fix bugs, and write unit tests; use third-party libraries; validate and extract data with regular expressions; model real-world entities with classes, objects, methods, and properties; and read and write files. Hands-on opportunities for lots of practice. Exercises inspired by real-world programming problems. No software required except for a web browser, or you can write code on your own PC or Mac.

**Note**: This course is *different* from CS50 or CS50x. CS50 is not part of the OSSU curriculum. That being said, if you have completed CS50, you can skip this course and move on to the next one.

### Instructions

 - If you want to follow along with the instructor, log in to the [CS50 "codespace"](https://cs50.dev) and watch [this video](https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/2022/shorts/visual_studio_code_for_cs50/) to get started.
 - Watch each lecture and complete the respective problem set. Read the lecture notes to revise things.
 - If you are stuck somewhere, feel free to ask questions. You can join the OSSU chat for this course here: <https://discord.gg/cBkssaJy5g>.
 - You can also join the CS50 discord server and ask questions there: <https://discord.gg/cs50>, but note that it is not affiliated with or maintained by OSSU.

### Fixes

1. If you're doing the BeautifulSoup4 lesson, there is an issue with Python 3.10+ that will give you an error referencing the Collections library. We have a fix for you. We don't expect you to understand it, just put this in front of your code in the imports block:

```python
import collections
collections.Callable = collections.abc.Callable

from bs4 import BeautifulSoup 
```

Doing this should fix the compatibility issue and allow your code to run.
